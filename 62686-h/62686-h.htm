<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to recommend that the two articles contributed by me to the
Yearbooks for 1894 and for 1895 on forestry for farmers be reprinted as a Farmers'
Bulletin. The articles contain information in popular form regarding the growth of
trees, the planting of a forest, treatment of the wood lot, the cultivation of the
wood crop, influence of trees, etc. A wider distribution of this information, for
which there is still considerable demand, would, I believe, result in acquainting
farmers with a subject the importance of which has not always been duly recognized.</p>

<h1>FORESTRY FOR FARMERS.</h1>



<p>The following five chapters have been written with the view of aiding
farmers who own small timber tracts or wood lots, or who wish to plant
some part of their land to forest. This country varies so greatly in soil,
climate, and flora that it is only possible, within the limits assigned
for the present discussion, to outline general principles everywhere
applicable. Nevertheless, wherever suggestions have approximated
the laying down of rules of practice, the writer has had mainly in mind
the conditions prevalent in our northeastern States. Moreover, for the
reason already referred to, limitation of space, it has not been possible
to give more than a comprehensive view, without much detail.</p>

<p>The succeeding chapters should be read connectedly, as they are
more or less interdependent. The first treats of the behavior of a
forest plant; the second, of the principles which should guide the
planter in setting a crop; the third, of the manner in which a natural
forest crop should be produced; the fourth points out how the crop
should be managed afterwards in order to secure the best results in
quantity and quality of material; while the fifth chapter is devoted
to a consideration of the relation of forests to farms.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HOW_TREES_GROW" id="HOW_TREES_GROW">1. HOW TREES GROW.</a></h2>


<p>Trees, like most other plants, originate from seed, build up a body of
cell tissues, form foliage, flower, and fruit, and take up food material
from the soil and air, which they convert into cellulose and other compounds,
from which all their parts are formed. They rely, like other
plants, upon moisture, heat, and light as the means of performing the
functions of growth. Yet there are some peculiarities in their behavior,
their life and growth, which require special attention on the part of
a tree grower or forest planter, and these we shall briefly discuss.</p>


<h3><a id="FOOD_MATERIALS_AND_CONDITIONS"></a>FOOD MATERIALS AND CONDITIONS OF GROWTH.</h3>

<p>Trees derive their food and solid substance in part from the air and
in part from the soil. The solid part of their bodies is made up of
cellulose, which consists largely of carbon (44 per cent of its weight),
with hydrogen and oxygen added in almost the same proportions as in
water. The carbon is derived from the carbonic acid of the air, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
enters into the leaves and, under the influence of light, air, and water,
is there decomposed; the oxygen is exhaled; the carbon is retained and
combined with elements derived from the water, forming compounds,
such as starch, sugar, etc., which are used as food materials, passing
down the tree through its outer layers to the very tips of the roots,
making new wood all along the branches, trunk, and roots.</p>

<p>This process of food preparation, called "assimilation," can be carried
on only in the green parts, and in these only when exposed to light
and air; hence foliage, air, and light at the top are essential prerequisites
for tree growth, and hence, other conditions being favorable, the
more foliage and the better developed it is, and the more light this
foliage has at its disposal for its work, the more vigorously will the
tree grow.</p>

<p>In general, therefore, pruning, since it reduces the amount of foliage,
reduces also, for the time, the amount of wood formed; and just so
shading, reducing the activity of foliage, reduces the growth of wood.</p>


<h3><a id="SOIL_CONDITIONS"></a>SOIL CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>From the soil trees take mainly water, which enters through the
roots and is carried through the younger part of the tree to the leaves,
to be used in part on its passage for food and wood formation and in
part to be given up to the air by transpiration.</p>

<p>In a vigorously growing tree the solid wood substance itself will contain
half its weight in the form of water chemically combined, and the
tree, in addition, will contain from 40 to 65 per cent and more of its dry
weight in water mechanically or "hygroscopically" held. This last,
when the tree is cut, very largely evaporates; yet well-seasoned wood
still contains 10 to 12 per cent of such water. The weight of a green
tree, a pine, for instance, is made up, in round numbers, of about 30 per
cent of carbon and 70 per cent or water, either chemically or hygroscopically
held, while a birch contains a still larger percentage of water.</p>

<p>The largest part of the water which passes through the tree is transpired&mdash;i. e.,
given off to the air in vapor. The amounts thus transpired
during the season vary greatly with the species of tree, its age, the
amount of foliage at work, the amount of light at its disposal, the climatic
conditions (rain, temperature, winds, relative humidity), and the
season. These amounts are, however, very large when compared with
the quantity retained; so that while an acre of forest may store in its
trees, say, 1,000 pounds of carbon, 15 to 20 pounds of mineral substances,
and 5,000 pounds of water in a year, it will have transpired&mdash;taken
up from, the soil and returned to the air&mdash;from 500,000 to 1,500,000
pounds of water (one-quarter to one-half as much as agricultural crops).</p>

<p>Mineral substances are taken up only in very small quantities, and
these are mostly the commoner sorts, such as lime, potash, magnesia,
and nitrogen. These are carried in solution to the leaves, where they
are used (as perhaps also on their passage through the tree), with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
part of the water, in food preparation. The main part of the mineral
substances taken up remains, however, as the water transpires, in the
leaves and young twigs, and is returned to the soil when the leaves
are shed or when the tree is cut and the brush left to decompose and
make humus.</p>

<p>Hence the improvement of the fertility of the soil by wood crops is
explained, the minerals being returned in more soluble form to the soil;
as also the fact that wood crops do not exhaust the soil of its minerals,
provided the leaves and litter are allowed to remain on the ground.</p>

<p>For this reason there is no necessity of alternating wood crops, as
far as their mineral needs are concerned; the same kind of trees can be
grown on the same soil continuously, provided the soil is not allowed
to deteriorate from other causes.</p>

<p>As the foliage can perform its work of food assimilation only when
sufficient water is at its disposal, the amount of growth is also dependent
not only on the presence of sufficient sources of supply, but also on the
opportunity had by the roots to utilize the supply, and this opportunity
is dependent upon the condition of the soil. If the soil is compact, so
that the rain water can not penetrate readily, and runs off superficially,
or if it is of coarse grain and so deep that the water rapidly sinks out
of reach of the roots and can not be drawn up by capillary action, the
water supply is of no avail to the plants; but if the soil is porous and
moderately deep (depth being the distance from the surface to the impenetrable
subsoil, rock, or ground water) the water not only can penetrate
but also can readily be reached and taken up by the roots.</p>

<p>The moisture of the soil being the most important element in it for
tree growth, the greatest attention must be given to its conservation
and most advantageous distribution through the soil.</p>

<p>No trees grow to the best advantage in very dry or very wet soil,
although some can live and almost thrive in such unfavorable situations.
A moderately but evenly moist soil, porous and deep enough or
fissured enough to be well drained, and yet of such a structure that
the water supplies from the depths can readily be drawn up and become
available to the roots&mdash;that is the soil on which all trees grow
most thriftily.</p>

<p>The agriculturist procures this condition of the soil as far as possible
by plowing, drainage, and irrigation, and he tries by cultivating to
keep the soil from compacting again, as it does under the influence of
the beating rain and of the drying out of the upper layers by sun and
wind.</p>

<p>The forest grower can not rely upon such methods, because they are
either too expensive or entirely impracticable. He may, indeed, plow
for his first planting, and cultivate the young trees, but in a few years
this last operation will become impossible and the effects of the first
operation will be lost. He must, therefore, attain his object in another
manner, namely, by shading and mulching the soil. The shading is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
done at first by planting very closely, so that the ground may be protected
as soon as possible from sun and wind, and by maintaining the
shade well throughout the period of growth. This shade is maintained,
if necessary, by more planting, and in case the main crop in later life
thins out inordinately in the crowns or tops, or by the accidental death
of trees, it may even become desirable to introduce an underbrush.</p>

<p>The mulching is done by allowing the fallen leaves and twigs to
remain and decay, and form a cover of rich mold or humus. This protective
cover permits the rain and snow waters to penetrate without at
the same time compacting the soil, keeping it granular and in best
condition for conducting water, and at the same time preventing evaporation
at the surface.</p>

<p>The soil moisture, therefore, is best maintained by proper soil cover,
which, however, is needful only in naturally dry soils. Wet soils,
although supporting tree growth, do not, if constantly wet, produce
satisfactory wood crops, the growth being very slow. Hence they must
be drained and their water level sunk below the depth of the root
system.</p>

<p>Irrigation is generally too expensive to be applied to wood crops,
except perhaps in the arid regions, where the benefit of the shelter belt
may warrant the expense.</p>

<p>Attention to favorable moisture conditions in the soil requires the
selection of such kinds of trees as shade well for a long time, to plant
closely, to protect the woody undergrowth (but not weeds), and to leave
the litter on the ground as a mulch.</p>

<p>Different species, to be sure, adapt themselves to different degrees
of soil moisture, and the crop should therefore be selected with reference
to its adaptation to available moisture supplies.</p>

<p>While, as stated, all trees thrive best with a moderate and even supply
of moisture, some can get along with very little, like the conifers, especially
pines; others can exist even with an excessive supply, as the bald
cypress, honey locust, some oaks, etc. The climate, however, must also
be considered in this connection, for a tree species, although succeeding
well enough on a dry soil in an atmosphere which does not require
much transpiration, may not do so in a drier climate on the same
soil.</p>

<p>In the selection of different kinds of trees for different soils, the
water conditions of the soil should, therefore, determine the choice.</p>


<h3><a id="LIGHT_CONDITIONS"></a>LIGHT CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>To insure the largest amount of growth, full enjoyment of sunlight
is needed. But as light is almost always accompanied by heat and
relative dryness of air, which demands water from the plant, and may
increase transpiration from the leaves inordinately, making them pump
too hard, as it were, young seedlings of tree species whose foliage is not
built for such strains require partial shading for the first year or two.
The conifers belong to this class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span></p>

<p>In later life the light conditions exert a threefold influence on the
development of the tree, namely, with reference to soil conditions,
with reference to form development, and with reference to amount of
growth.</p>

<p>The art of the forester consists in regulating the light conditions so
as to secure the full benefit of the stimulating effect of light on growth,
without its deteriorating influences on the soil and on form development.</p>

<p>As we have seen, shade is desirable in order to preserve soil moisture.
Now, while young trees of all kinds, during the "brush" stage of development,
have a rather dense foliage, as they grow older they vary in
habit, especially when growing in the forest. Some, like the beech,
the sugar maple, the hemlock, and the spruce, keep up a dense crown;
others, like the chestnut, the oaks, the walnut, the tulip tree, and the
white pine, thin out more and more, and when fully grown have a much
less dense foliage; Anally, there are some which do not keep up a dense
shade for any length of time, like the black and honey locust, with
their small, thin leaves; the catalpa, with its large but few leaves at
the end of the branchlets only, and the larch, with its short, scattered
bunches of needles. So we can establish a comparative scale of trees
with reference to the amount of shade which they can give continuously,
as densely foliaged and thinly foliaged, in various gradations. If
we planted all beech or sugar maple, the desirable shading of the soil
would never be lacking, while if we planted all locust or catalpa the
sun would soon reach the soil and dry it out, or permit a growth of
grass or weeds, which is worse, because those transpire still larger quantities
of water than the bare ground evaporates or an undergrowth of
woody plants would transpire. Of course, a densely foliaged tree has
many more leaves to shed than a thinly foliaged one, and therefore
makes more litter, which increases the favorable mulch cover of the soil.
Another reason for keeping the ground well shaded is that the litter
then decomposes slowly, but into a desirable humus, which acts favorably
upon the soil, while if the litter is exposed to light, an undesirable,
partly decomposed "raw" humus is apt to be formed.</p>

<p>Favorable soil conditions, then, require shade, while wood growth
is increased by full enjoyment of light; to satisfy both requirements,
mixed planting, with proper selection of shade-enduring and light-needing
species, is resorted to.</p>

<p>As the different species afford shade in different degrees, so they
require for their development different degrees of light. The dense
foliage of the beech, with a large number of leaves in the interior of
the crown, proves that the leaves can exist and perform their work with
a small amount of light; the beech is a shade-enduring tree. The
scanty foliage of the birches, poplars, or pines shows that these are
light-needing trees; hence they are never found under the dense shade
of the former, while the shade-enduring can develop satisfactorily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
under the light shade of the thin-foliaged kinds. Very favorable soil
conditions increase the shade endurance of the latter, and climatic
conditions also modify their relative position in the scale.</p>

<p>All trees ultimately thrive best&mdash;i. e., grow most vigorously&mdash;in the
full enjoyment of light, but their energy then goes into branching.
Crowded together, with the side light cut off, the lower lateral branches
soon die and fall, while the main energy of growth is put into the
shaft and the height growth is stimulated. The denser shade of the
shade-enduring kinds, if placed as neighbors to light-needing ones, is
most effective in producing this result, provided that the light is not
cut off at the top; and thus, in practice, advantage is taken of the
relative requirements for light of the various species.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This relation of the different species to varying light conditions; their comparative
shading value and shade endurance, is one of the most important facts to be
observed and utilized by the forester. European foresters have done this, but since
they had to deal with only a few species and over a limited territory, they could
quite readily classify their trees with reference to their shade endurance, and take
it for granted that shade endurance and density of foliage or shading value were
more or less identical. With our great wealth of useful species it will be necessary
and profitable to be more exact in the classification.</p></div>

<p>The forester finds in close planting and in mixed growth a means of
securing tall, clear trunks, free from knots, and he is able, moreover,
by proper regulation of light conditions, to influence the form development,
and also the quality of his crop, since slow growth and rapid
growth produce wood of different character.</p>

<p>There are some species which, although light-foliaged and giving
comparatively little shade, are yet shade-enduring&mdash;i. e., can subsist,
although not develop favorably, under shade; the oaks are examples of
this kind. Others, like the black cherry, bear a dense crown for the
first twenty years, perhaps, seemingly indicating great shade endurance;
but the fact that the species named soon clears itself of its
branches and finally has a thin crown, indicates that it is light-needing,
though a good shader for the first period of its life. Others, again, like
the catalpa, which is shady and shade-enduring, as the difficulty with
which it clears itself indicates, leaf out so late and lose their foliage
so early that their shading value is thereby impaired. Black locust
and honey locust, on the other hand, leave no doubt either as to their
light-needing or their inferior shading quality.</p>

<p>That soil conditions and climatic conditions also modify crown development
and shade endurance has been well recognized abroad, but in
our country this influence is of much more importance on account of
the great variation in those conditions. Thus the box elder, an excellent
shader in certain portions of the West, is a failure as soil cover in
others where it nevertheless will grow.</p>

<p>We see, then, that in determining the shading value as well as the
shade endurance of one species in comparison with another, with reference
to forestry purposes, not only soil and climate but also the character
of foliage and its length of season must be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="PHYSIOLOGY_OF_TREE_GROWTH"></a>PHYSIOLOGY OF TREE GROWTH.</h3>

<p>As we have seen, root and foliage are the main life organs of the
tree. The trunk and branches serve to carry the crown upward and
expose it to the light, which is necessary in order to prepare the food
and increase the volume of the tree, and also as conductors of food
materials up and down between root and foliage. A large part of the
roots, too, aside from giving stability to the tree, serve only as conductors
of water and food material; only the youngest parts, the fibrous roots,
beset with innumerable fine hairs, serve to take up the water and minerals
from the soil. These fine roots, root hairs, and young parts are
therefore the essential portion of the root system. A tree may have a
fine, vigorous-looking root system, yet if the young parts and fibrous
roots are cut off or allowed to dry out, which they readily do&mdash;some
kinds more so than others&mdash;thereby losing their power to take up water,
such a tree is apt to die. Under very favorable moisture and temperature
conditions, however, the old roots may throw out now sprouts and
replace the fibrous roots. Some species, like the willows, poplars,
locusts, and others, are especially capable of doing so. All trees that
"transplant easily" probably possess this capacity of renewing the
fibrous roots readily, or else are less subject to drying out. But it may
be stated as a probable fact that most transplanted trees which die
soon after the planting do so because the fibrous roots have been curtailed
too much in taking up, or else have been allowed to dry out on
the way from the nursery or forest to the place of planting; they were
really dead before being set. Conifers&mdash;pines, spruces, etc.&mdash;are especially
sensitive; maples, oaks, catalpas, and apples will, in this respect,
stand a good deal of abuse.</p>

<p>Hence, in transplanting, the first and foremost care of the forest,
grower, besides taking the sapling up with least injury, is the proper
protection of its root fibers against drying out.</p>

<p>The water, with the minerals in solution, is taken up by the roots
when the soil is warm enough, but to enable the roots to act they must
be closely packed with the soil. It is conveyed mostly through the outer,
which are the younger, layers of the wood of root, trunk, and branches
to the leaves. Here, as we have seen, under the influence of light and
heat it is in large part transpired and in part combined with the carbon
into organic compounds, sugar, etc., which serve as food materials.
These travel from the leaf into the branchlet, and down through the
outer layers of the trunk to the very tips of the root, forming new wood
all the way, new buds, which lengthen into shoots, leaves, and flowers,
and also new rootlets. To live and grow, therefore, the roots need the
food elaborated in the leaves, just as the leaves need the water sent up
from the roots.</p>

<p>Hence the interdependence of root system and crown, which must be
kept in proportion when transplanting. At least, the root system must
be sufficient to supply the needs of the crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="SAP_UP_SAP_DOWN"></a>"SAP UP AND SAP DOWN."</h3>

<p>The growing tree, in all its parts, is more or less saturated with
water, and as the leaves, under the influence of sun and wind and
atmospheric conditions generally transpire, new supplies are taken in
through the roots and conveyed to the crown. This movement takes
place even in winter, in a slight degree, to supply the loss of water by
evaporation from the branches. In the growing season it is so active as
to become noticeable; hence
the saying that the sap is
"up," or "rising," and when,
toward the end of the season,
the movement becomes less,
the sap is said to be "down."
But this movement of water
is always upward; hence the
notion that there is a stream
upward at one season and in
one part of the tree, and a
stream downward at another
season and perhaps in another
part of the tree, is erroneous.
The downward movement is
of food materials, and the two
movements of water upward
and food downward take place
simultaneously, and depend,
in part at least, one upon the
other, the food being carried
to the young parts, wherever
required, by a process of diffusion
from cell to cell known as
"osmosis."</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 341px;">
<a name="fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/unt_fig_1.png" width="341" height="617" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Physiological importance of different parts of
the tree; pathways of water and food materials. (Schematic.)</div>
</div>

<p>These food materials are,
by the life processes of the
active cells, changed in chemical
composition as need be,
from sugar, which is soluble,
into starch, which is insoluble,
and back into sugar, and combined
with nitrogenous substances to make the cell-forming material,
protoplasm (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>In the fall, when the leaves cease to elaborate food, both the upward
and the downward movement, more or less simultaneously, come to
rest (the surplus of food materials, as starch, and sometimes as sugar,
being stored for the winter in certain cell tissues), to begin again simultaneously
when in spring the temperature is high enough to reawaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
activity, when the stored food of last year is dissolved and started on
its voyage. The exact manner in which this movement of water upward
and food materials downward takes place, and the forces at work, are
not yet fully understood, nor is there absolute certainty as to the parts
of the tree in which the movement takes place. It appears, however,
that while all the so-called "sapwood" is capable of conducting water
(the heartwood is probably not), the most active movement of both
water and food materials takes place in the cambium (the growing
cells immediately beneath the bark) and youngest parts of the bark.</p>

<p>The deductions from these processes important to the planter are:
That injury to the living bark or bast means injury to growth, if not
destruction to life; that during the period of vegetation transplanting
can be done only with great caution; that the best time to move trees
is in the fall, when the leaves have dropped and the movement of water
and food materials has mostly ceased, or in spring, before the movement
begins again, the winter being objectionable only because of the
difficulty of working the soil and of keeping the roots protected against
frost. All things considered, spring planting, before activity in the
tree has begun, is the best, although it is not impossible to plant at
other times.</p>


<h3><a id="PROGRESS_OF_DEVELOPMENT"></a>PROGRESS OF DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p>Like the wheat or corn plant, the tree seed require as conditions for
sprouting sufficient moisture, warmth, and air. Tree seeds, however,
differ from grain in that most of the kinds lose their power of germination
easily; with few exceptions (locust, pine, spruce), they can not
be kept for any length of time.</p>

<p>The first leaves formed often differ essentially in shape from those of
the mature tree, which may cause their being confounded with other
plants, weeds, etc.</p>

<p>The little seedlings of many, especially the conifers, are quite delicate,
and remain very small the first season; they need, therefore, the protecting
shade of mother trees, or artificial shading, and also protection
against weeds. The amount of light or shade given requires careful
regulation for some of them; too much light and heat will kill them,
and so will too much shade. This accounts for the failure of many
seedlings that spring up in the virgin forest.</p>

<p>The planter, then, is required to know the nature and the needs of
the various kinds of seeds and seedlings, so as to provide favorable
conditions, when he will avoid sowing in the open field such as require
the care which it is impracticable to give outside of the nursery.</p>

<h3><a id="GROWTH_IN_LENGTH"></a>GROWTH IN LENGTH AND RAMIFICATION.</h3>

<p>While the stalk of wheat or corn grows for one season, exhausts
itself in seed production, and then dies, the tree continues to grow
from season to season, in length as well as in thickness. The growth
in length of shaft and branches proceeds from buds, made up of
cell tissues, which can subdivide and lengthen into shoots, as well
as make leaves. These buds are formed during summer, and when
winter begins contain embryo leaves, more or less developed, under
the protecting cover of scales (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>). When spring stimulates the
young plant to new activity, the buds swell, shed their scales, distend
their cells, increasing their number
by subdivision, and thus the leaves expand,
and the bud lengthens into a
shoot and twig. During the season new
buds are formed, and the whole process
repeats itself from year to year, giving
rise to the ramification and height
growth of the tree. The end buds being
mostly stronger and better developed,
the main axis of tree or branch increases
more rapidly than the rest. All these
buds originate from the youngest, central
part of the shoot, the pith, and hence
when the tree grows in thickness, enveloping
the base of the limbs, their connection with the pith can always
be traced. This is the usual manner of bud formation; in addition,
so-called "adventitious" buds maybe formed from the young living
wood in later life, which are not connected with the pith. Such buds
are those which develop into sprouts from the stump when the tree is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
cut; also those which give rise to what are known as "water sprouts."
Many buds, although formed, are, however, not developed at once, and
perhaps not at all, especially as the tree grows older; these either die
or remain "dormant," often for a hundred years, to spring into life
when necessary (<a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>The fact that each ordinary limb starts as a bud from the pith is an
important one to the timber grower; it explains knotty timber and
gives him the hint that in order to obtain clear timber the branches
first formed must be soon removed,
either by the knife or by proper
shading, which kills the branches and
thus "clears" the shaft.</p>

<p>The planter has it also in his power
to influence the form development of
the tree by removing some of the
buds, giving thereby better chance to the remaining ones. This
pruning of buds is, where practicable, often better practice than the
pruning of limbs.</p>

<p>Since the tree does not grow in length except by its buds it is evident
that a limb which started to grow at the height of 6 feet has its
base always 6 feet from the ground, and if allowed to grow to size,
must be surrounded by the wood which accumulates on the main stem
or trunk. If a limb is killed and broken off early, only a slender stub
composed entirely of rapidly decaying sapwood, is left, occasioning,
therefore, only a small defect in the heart of the tree; but if left to
grow to considerable age, the base of the limb is encased by the wood of
the stem, which, when the tree is cut into lumber, appears as a knot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
The longer the limb has been allowed to grow, the farther out is the timber
knotty and the thicker is the knot. If the limb remained alive, the
knot is "sound," closely grown together with the fibers of the tree. If
the limb died off, the remaining stub may behave in different ways. In
pines it will be largely composed of heartwood, very resinous and durable;
separated from the fibers of the overgrowing wood, it forms a
"loose" knot, which is apt to fall out of a board, leaving a hole.</p>

<p>In broad-leaved trees, where no resin assists in the process of healing,
the stub is apt to decay, and this decay, caused by the growth of
fungi, is apt to penetrate into the tree (<a href="#fig_6">fig. 6</a>). In parks and orchards,
pruning is resorted to, and the cuts are painted or tarred to avoid the
decay. In well-managed forests and dense woods in general, the light
is cut off, the limb is killed when young and breaks away, the shaft
"clears itself," and the sound trunk furnishes a good grade of material.
The difference in development of the branch system, whether in full
enjoyment of light, in open stand,
or with the side light cut off, in
dense position, is shown in the
accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig_7">fig. 7</a>).</p>

of the stem covering the wound; shaded portion,

</div>

<p>Both trees start alike; the one retains its branches, the other
loses them gradually, the stubs
being in time overgrown; finally
the second has a clear shaft, with
a crown concentrated at the top,
while the first is beset with
branches and branch stubs for its
whole length (<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p>When ripped open lengthwise,
the interior exhibits the condition
shown in <a href="#fig_9">figure 9</a>, the dead
parts of the knot being indicated
in heavier shading. Since the brandies grow in more or less regular
whorls, several knots, stumps, or limbs are met every 6 to 24 inches
through the entire stem.</p>

<p>Hence, in forest planting, trees are placed and kept for some time close
together, in order to decrease the branching in the lower part of the
tree and thus produce a clean bole and clear lumber.</p>

<h3><a id="GROWTH_IN_THICKNESS"></a>GROWTH IN THICKNESS.</h3>

<p>The young seedling and the young shoot of the older tree much
resemble in interior structure that of any herbaceous plant, being
composed of a large amount of pith, loose squarish cells, and a few
bundles of long fibers symmetrically distributed about the center, the
whole covered with a thin skin or epidermis. Each strand or bundle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
fibers, called fibro-vascular (fiber-vessel) bundles, consists of two kinds,
namely, wood fibers on the inner side and bast fibers of different
structure on the outer side. Between these two sets of fibers, the bast
and the wood, there is a row of cells which form the really active,
growing part of the plantlet, the cambium. The cambium cells are
actively subdividing and expanding, giving off wood cells to the interior
and bast cells to the exterior, and extending at the same time side-wise,
until at the end of the season not only are the wood and bast
portions increased in lines radiating from the center, but the cambium
layer, the wood cells, and the
bast cells of all the bundles
(scattered at the beginning) join
at the sides to form a complete
ring, or rather hollow cylinder,
around the central pith. Only
here and there the pith cells
remain, interrupting the wood
cylinder and giving rise to the
system of cells known as medullary
rays. The cross-section
now shows a comparatively
small amount of pith and bast
or bark and a larger body of
strong wood fibers. The new
shoot at the end, to be sure,
has the same appearance and
arrangement as the young
plantlet had, the pith preponderating,
and the continuous
cylinder of cambium, bast, and
wood being separated into
strands or bundles.</p>

<p>During the season, through
the activity of the cambial part
of the bundles, the same changes
take place in the new shoot as
did the previous year in the
young seedling, while at the
same time the cambium in the
yearling part also actively subdivides,
forming new wood and bast cells, and thus a second ring, or
rather cylinder, is formed. The cambium of the young shoot is always
a continuation of that of the ring or cylinder formed the year before,
and this cambium cylinder always keeps moving outward, so that at
the end of the season, when activity ceases, it is always the last minute
layer of cells on the outside of the wood, between wood proper and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
bark. It is here, therefore, that the life of the tree lies, and any injury
to the cambium must interfere with the growth and life of the tree.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 376px;">
<a name="fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/unt_fig_9.png" width="376" height="577" alt="" />

in a dense forest; <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, whorls of knots; <i>b</i>, dead limb;
<i>sk</i>, "sound knot;" <i>dk</i>, "dead knot."</div>
</div>

<p>The first wood cells which the cambium forms in the spring are
usually or always of a more open structure, thin-walled, and with a large
opening or "lumen," comparable to a blown-up paper bag; so large, in
fact, sometimes, is the "lumen" that the width of the cells can be seen
on a cross-section with the naked eye, as, for instance, in oak, ash,
elm, the so-called "pores" are this open wood formed in spring. The
cells, which are formed
later in summer, have
mostly thick walls, are
closely crowded and
compressed, and show
a very small opening or
"lumen," being comparable,
perhaps, to a
very thick wooden box.
They appear in the cross-section not only denser
but of a deeper color,
on account of their
crowded, compressed
condition and thicker
walls. Since at the beginning
of the next season
again thin-walled
cells with wide openings
or lumina are
formed, this difference
in the appearance of
"spring wood" and
"summer wood" enables
us to distinguish
the layer of wood
formed each year. This
"annual ring" is more
conspicuous in Some
kinds than in others.
In the so-called "ring porous" woods, like oak, ash, elm, the rings are
easily distinguished by the open spring wood; in the conifers, especially
pines, by the dark-colored summer wood; while in maple, birch,
tulip, etc., only a thin line of flattened, hence darker and regularly
aligned, summer cells, often hardly recognizable, distinguishes The
rings from each other. Cutting through a tree, therefore, we can not
only ascertain its age by counting its annual layers in the cross-section,
but also determine how much wood is formed each year (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>). We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
can, in fact, retrace the history of its growth, the vicissitudes through
which it has passed, by the record preserved in its ring growth.</p>

<p>To ascertain the age of a tree correctly, however, we must cut so
near to the ground as to include the growth of the first year's little
plantlet; any section higher up shows as many years too few as it took
the tree to reach that height.</p>

<p>This annual-ring formation is the rule in all countries which have
distinct seasons of summer and winter and temporary cessation of
growth. Only exceptionally
a tree may fail to make
its growth throughout its
whole length on account
of loss of foliage or other
causes; and occasionally,
when its growth has been
disturbed during the season,
a "secondary" ring,
resembling the annual
ring, and distinguishable
only by the expert, may
appear and mar the record.</p>

<p>To the forest planter this
chapter on ring growth is
of great importance, because
not only does this
feature of tree life afford
the means of watching the
progress of his crop, calculating
the amount of
wood formed, and therefrom
determining when it
is most profitable for him
to harvest (namely, when
the annual or periodic
wood growth falls below a
certain amount), but since
the proportion of summer
wood and spring wood
determines largely the quality of the timber, and since he has it in
his power to influence the preponderance of the one or other by
adaptation of species to soils and by their management, ring growth
furnishes an index for regulating the quality of his crop.</p>


<h3 style="clear: both;"><a id="FORM_DEVELOPMENT"></a>FORM DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p>If a tree is allowed to grow in the open, it has a tendency to branch,
and makes a low and spreading crown. In order to lengthen its shaft
and to reduce the number of branches it is necessary to narrow its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
growing space, to shade its sides so that the lower branches and their
foliage do not receive light enough to perform their functions. When
the side shade is dense enough, these branches die and finally break
off under the influence of winds and fungous growth; wood then forms
over the scars and we get a clean shaft
which carries a crown high up beyond the
reach of shade from neighbors.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 236px;">
<a name="fig_10"></a>
<img src="images/unt_fig_10.png" width="236" height="693" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Scheme to Illustrate the arrangement
of annual growth. 1, 2, 3,
etc., represent the parts of the stem
grown during the first, second, third,
etc., twenty years of the life of the
tree, <i>k</i>, knots; the shaded part of each
is the "dead knot" of lumber.</div>
</div>

<p>The branches being prevented from
spreading out, the shaft is forced to grow
upward, and hence, when crowded by
others, trees become taller and more
cylindrical in form, while in the open,
where they can spread, they remain lower
and more conical in form (figs. <a href="#fig_11">11</a>, <a href="#fig_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>There are, to be sure, different natural
types of development, some, like the walnuts,
oaks, beeches, and the broad-leaved
trees generally, having greater tendency
to spread than others, like spruces, firs,
and conifers in general, which lengthen
their shaft in preference to spreading,
even in the open. This tendency to spreading
is also influenced by soil conditions
and climate, as well as by the age of the
tree. When the trees cease to grow in
height, their crowns broaden, and this
takes place sooner in shallow soils than in
deep, moist ones; but the tendency can
be checked and all can be made to develop
the shaft at the expense of the branches
by proper shading from the sides.</p>

<p>It follows that the forest planter, who
desires to produce long and clean shafts
and best working quality of timber, must
secure and maintain side shade by a close
stand, while the landscape gardener, who
desires characteristic form, must maintain
an open stand and full enjoyment of light
for his trees.</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen, different species
afford different amounts of shade, and in
proportion to the shade which they afford
can they endure shade. The beech or sugar maple or spruce, which
maintain a large amount of foliage under the dense shade of their
own crown, show that their leaves can live and functionate with a small
amount of light. They are shade-enduring trees. On the other hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
the black walnut, the locust, the catalpa, the poplars, and the larch
show by the manner in which their crowns thin out, the foliage being
confined to the ends of the branches, that their leaves require more
light&mdash;they are light-needing trees; so that the scale which arranges
the trees according to the amount of shade they exert serves also to
measure their shade endurance.</p>

<p>In making, therefore, mixed plantations, the different kinds must be
so grouped and managed that the shady trees will not outgrow and
overtop the light-needing; the latter must either have the start of the
former or must be quicker growers.</p>

<h3><a id="RATE_OF_GROWTH"></a>RATE OF GROWTH.</h3>

<p>Not only do different species grow more or less rapidly in height and
girth, but there is in each species a difference in the rate of growth
during different periods of life, and
a difference in the persistence of
growth.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that trees grow
differently in different soils and situations,
and hence we can not compare
different species with respect
to their rate of growth except as they grow under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Thus the black walnut may grow as fast as or faster than the ash on
a rich, deep, moist, warm soil, but will soon fall to the rear in a wetter,
colder, and shallower soil.</p>

<p>Given the same conditions, some species will start on a rapid upward
growth at once, like the poplars, aspen, locust, and silver maple, making
rapid progress (the most rapid from their tenth to their fifteenth year),
but decreasing soon in rate and reaching their maximum height early.
Others, like the spruce, beech, and sugar maple, will begin slowly, often
occupying several, sometimes as many as 10 to 15, years before they
appear to grow at all, their energy all going into root growth. Then
comes a period of more and more accelerated growth, which reaches its
maximum rate at 25 or 30 years; and when the cottonwood or aspen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
has reached the end of its growth in height the spruce or pine is still
at its best rate, and continues to grow for a long time at that rate; in
later life the rate decreases, yet height growth sometimes does not
cease altogether for centuries. As a rule, the light-needing species are
the ones which show the rapid height growth at the start, while the
shade-enduring are slow at the start, but persistent growers.</p>

<p>This fact is important in explaining the alternations of forest growth
in nature; the persistent shade-enduring species crowd out the light-needing,
and the latter rapidly take possession of any openings that
fire or storm has made. It is also important with reference to the management
of wood crops and starting of mixed plantations; the light-needing
species must be mixed only with such shade-enduring species
as are slower growers than themselves.</p>

<p>The diameter growth shows also periodic changes in its rate, and is, of
course, influenced in the same way by soil, climate, and light conditions,
as the height growth.</p>

<p>In the juvenile or brush stage, lasting 6 to 10 years in light-needing and
20 to 40 years in shade-enduring species, the diameter grows comparatively
little, all energy being directed to height growth and root growth.
When the crown has been definitely formed, more food material is available
for wood formation, and the increase in foliage is accompanied
by a more rapid increase of trunk diameter; in favorable situations,
the highest rate occurs between the fortieth and sixtieth years; in the
poorer situations, between the fiftieth and eightieth years, which rate
continues for some time. Then comes a period of slower rate, which
finally in old age dwindles down almost to zero.</p>

<p>But neither the diameter growth nor the width of the annual rings
alone tells us directly what amount of wood is forming. The outer
rings, being laid over a larger circumference, although thinner than the
preceding rings, may yet have greater cubic contents. The statements
of diameter growth are, therefore, misleading if we are interested in
knowing how much wood is forming.</p>

<p>Accordingly the growth in volume must be considered separately, as
determined by the enlargement of the cross-section area and the height.
The growth in volume or mass accretion is quite small in young trees,
so that when wood is cut young the smallest amount of crop per year
is harvested, while, if it is allowed to grow, an increase more than proportionate
to the number of years may be obtained.</p>

<p>Only when the tree has a fully developed crown does it begin to
make much wood. Its volume growth progresses then at a uniform
rate, and continues to do so for decades, and sometimes for a century
or more.</p>

<p>On poorer sites the rate is slower, but remains longer on the increase,
while on good sites the maximum rate is soon reached.</p>

<p>Of course, in a forest, where light conditions are not most favorable,
because form development and soil conditions require shade, the total
wood formation is less than in an isolated tree, favorably placed. Just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
so the dominant trees in a forest&mdash;i. e., those which have their crowns
above all others&mdash;show, of course, the advantage they have over the
inferior trees which are suffering from the shade of their neighbors.</p>

<p>Finally, if we would take into consideration an entire forest growth,
and determine, for instance, how much wood an acre of such forest produces
at different periods, we must not overlook the fact that the number
of trees per acre changes as the trees grow older. Some of them
are overshaded and crowded out by the others, so that a young growth
of spruce might start with 100,000 little seedlings to the acre, of which
in the twentieth year only 10,000 would be alive, while in the fortieth
year the number would be reduced to 1,200, and in the hundredth year
to 280. Hence the rate of growth of any single tree gives no idea of
what the acre of forest will do.</p>

<p>Tims, while a single good white pine might grow the fastest in volume
when about one hundred years old, then making wood at the rate
of, say, 1.5 cubic feet per year, an acre of pine on good soil, containing
about 1,600 trees, may make the most wood in the thirtieth year, then
growing at the rate of 170 cubic feet per acre, while in the hundredth
year the rate would not exceed 70 cubic feet; and an acre of pine in a
poorer location, with about 1,400 trees, may make the most wood in the
fortieth year, at the rate of 100 cubic feet per acre.</p>

<p>From the consideration of the relation of light conditions to soil conditions,
to form development, and to rate of growth, we may make the
following deductions of interest to the forest planter:</p>

<p>In order to secure the best results in wood production, in quantity
and quality, at the same time preserving favorable soil conditions, the
forest should be composed of various species, a mixture of light-needing
and shade-enduring kinds. The light-needing ones should be of quicker
growth; the shady ones, in larger numbers, should be slower growers.
For the first fifteen to twenty-five years the plantation should be kept
as dense as possible, to secure clear shafts and good growth in height;
then it should be thinned, to increase crown development and diameter
growth; the thinning, however, is not to be so severe that the crowns
can not close up again in two or three years; the thinning is to be
repeated again and again, always favoring the best developed trees.</p>


<h3><a id="REPRODUCTION"></a>REPRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>All trees reproduce themselves naturally from seed. Man can secure
their reproduction also from cuttings or layers; and some kinds can
reproduce themselves by shoots from the stump when the parent tree
has been cut. This latter capacity is possessed in a varying degree
by different species; chestnuts, oaks, elms, maples, poplars, and willows
are most excellent sprouters; most conifers do not sprout at all, and the
shoots of those that do sprout soon die (Sequoia or California redwood
seems to be an exception). Sprouts of broad-leaved trees develop differently
from seedlings, growing very rapidly at first, but soon lessening
in the rate of growth and never attaining the height and perhaps not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
the diameter of trees grown from the seed; they are also shorter lived.
With age the stumps lose their capacity for sprouting. To secure best
results, the parent tree should be cut close to the ground in early spring,
avoiding severe frost, and a sharp cut should be made which will not
sever the bark from the trunk.</p>

<p>Not all trees bear seed every year, and plentiful seed production,
especially in a forest, occurs, as a rule, periodically. The periods differ
with species, climate, and season.</p>

<p>Not all seeds can germinate, and in some species the number of seeds
that can germinate is very small, and they lose their power of germination
when kept a few hours, like the willows. Others, if kept till they
have become dry, will "lie over" in the soil a year or more before germinating.
The same thing will occur if they are covered too deep in
the soil, provided they germinate at all under such conditions.</p>

<p>In order to germinate, seeds must have warmth, air, and moisture.
The preparation of a seed bed is, therefore, necessary in order to supply
these conditions in most favorable combination. In the natural forest
millions of seeds rot or dry without sprouting, and millions of seedlings
sprout, but soon perish under the too dense shade of the mother trees.</p>

<p>Man, desiring to reproduce a valuable wood crop, cannot afford to be
as lavish as nature, and must therefore improve upon nature's methods,
making more careful preparation for the production of his crop, either
by growing the seedlings in nurseries and transplanting them, or else
by cutting away the old growth in such a manner as to secure to the
young self-grown crop better chances for life and development.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_PLANT_A_FOREST" id="HOW_TO_PLANT_A_FOREST">2. HOW TO PLANT A FOREST.</a></h2>


<p>Forest planting and tree planting are two different things. The
orchardist, who plants for fruit; the landscape gardener, who plants for
form; the roadside planter, who plants for shade, all have objects in view
different from that of the forest planter, and therefore select and use
their plant material differently. They deal with single individual trees,
each one by itself destined for a definite purpose. The forester, on the
other hand, plants a crop like the farmer; he deals not with the single
seed or plant, but with masses of trees; the individual tree has value
to him only as apart of the whole. It may come to harvest for its timber,
or it may not come to harvest, and yet have answered its purpose
as a part of the whole in shading the ground, or acting as nurse or
"forwarder" as long as it was necessary.</p>

<p>His object is not to grow trees, but to produce wood, the largest
amount of the best quality per acre, whether it be stored in one tree or
in many, and his methods must be directed to that end.</p>

<p>As far as the manner of setting out plants or sowing seeds is concerned,
the same general principles and the same care in manipulation
are applicable as in any other planting, except as the coat of operating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
on so Large a scale may necessitate less careful methods than the gardener
or nurseryman can afford to apply; the nearer, however, the
performance of planting can be brought to the careful manner of the
gardener, the surer the success. The principles underlying such
methods have been discussed in the chapter "<a href="#HOW_TREES_GROW">How trees grow</a>;" in the
present chapter it is proposed to point out briefly the special considerations
which should guide the forest planter in particular.</p>


<h3><a id="WHAT_TREES_TO_PLANT"></a>WHAT TREES TO PLANT.</h3>

<p><i>Adaptability to climate</i> is the first requisite in the species to be
planted.</p>

<p>It is best to choose from the native growth of the region which is
known to be adapted to it. With regard to species not native, the
reliance must be placed upon the experience of neighboring planters
and upon experiment (at first on a small scale), after study of the
requirements of the kinds proposed for trial.</p>

<p>Adaptation must be studied, not only with reference to temperature
ranges and rainfall, but especially with reference to atmospheric
humidity and requirements of transpiration.</p>

<p>Many species have a wide range of natural distribution, and hence
of climatic adaptation. If such are to be used, it is important to secure
seeds from that part of the range of natural distribution where the
plants must be hardiest, i. e., the coldest and driest region in which it
occurs, which insures hardy qualities in the offspring. For instance,
the Douglas spruce from the humid and evenly tempered Pacific Slope
will not be as hardy as that grown from seed collected on the dry
and frigid slopes of the Rockies. Lack of attention to this requisite
accounts for many failures. It must also be kept in mind that, while a
species may be able to grow in another than its native climate, its wood
may not there have the same valuable qualities which it develops in
its native habitat.</p>

<p><i>Adaptability to soil</i> must be studied less with reference to mineral
constituents than to physical condition. Depth and moisture conditions,
and the structure of the soil, which influences the movement of
water in it, are the most important elements. While all trees thrive
best in a moist to "fresh" soil of moderate depth (from 2 to 4 feet)
and granular structure, some can adapt themselves to drier or wetter,
shallow, and compact soils. Fissures in rocks into which the roots can
penetrate often stand for depth of soil, and usually aid in maintaining
favorable moisture conditions. In soils of great depth (i. e., from the
surface to the impenetrable subsoil) and of coarse structure water may
drain away so fast as not to be available to the roots.</p>

<p>Soil moisture must always be studied in conjunction with atmospheric
moisture; for, while a species may thrive in an arid soil, when the
demands of transpiration are not great, it may not do so when aridity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
of atmosphere is added. Trees of the swamp are apt to be indifferent
to soil moisture and to thrive quite well, if not better, in drier soils.</p>

<p><i>Adaptability to site.</i>&mdash;While a species may be well adapted to the
general climatic conditions of a region, and in general to the soil, there
still remains to be considered its adaptability to the particular "site,"
under which term we may comprise the total effect of general climate,
local climate, and soil. The general climatic conditions are locally
influenced, especially by the slope, exposure, or aspect, and the surroundings.
Thus we know that eastern exposures are more liable to
frost, western exposures more liable to damage from winds, southern
more apt to be hot and to dry out, and northern to be cooler and
damper, having in consequence a shorter period of vegetation. Hollows
and lowlands are more exposed to frosts and more subject to
variations in soil moisture, etc.</p>

<p>Hence for these various situations it is advisable to select species
which can best withstand such local dangers.</p>

<p><i>The use value, or utility</i>, of the species is next to be considered. This
must be done with reference to the commercial and domestic demand,
and the length of time it takes the species to attain its value. The
greater variety of purposes a wood may serve&mdash;i. e., the greater its
general utility&mdash;and the sooner it attains its use value the better.
White pine for the northeastern States as a wood is like the apple
among fruits, making an all-round useful material in large quantities
per acre in short time. Tulip poplar, applicable to a wider climatic
range, is almost as valuable, while oak, ash, and hickory are standard
woods in the market. Other woods are of limited application. Thus
the black locust, which grows most quickly into useful posts, has only
a limited market, much more limited than it should have; hickory soon
furnishes valuable hoop poles from the thinnings, and later the best
wagon material, not, however, large quantities in a short time; while
black walnut of good quality is very high in price, the market is also
limited, and the dark color of the heartwood, for which it is prized, is
attained only by old trees. The black cherry, used for similar purposes,
attains its value much sooner.</p>

<p>By planting various species together, variety of usefulness may be
secured and the certainty of a market increased.</p>

<p><i>The forest value</i> of the species is only in part expressed by its use
value. As has been shown in another place, the composition of the
crop must be such as to insure maintenance of favorable soil conditions,
as well as satisfactory development of the crop itself. Some
species, although of high use value, like ash, oak, etc, are poor preservers
of soil conditions, allowing grass and weeds to enter the plantation
and to deteriorate the soil under their thin foliage. Others, like
beech, sugar maple, box elder, etc., although of less use value, being
dense foliaged and preserving a shady crown for a long time, are of
great forest value as soil improvers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>Again, as the value of logs depends largely on their freedom from
knots, straightness, and length, it is of importance to secure these
qualities. Some valuable species, if grown by themselves, make crooked
trunks, do not clean their shafts of branches, and are apt to spread
rather than lengthen. If planted in close companionship with others,
they are forced by these "nurses or forwarders" to make better growths
and clean their shafts of branches.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from financial considerations, it is well to know that
some species develop more rapidly and produce larger quantities of
useful material per acre than others; thus the white pine is a "big
cropper," and, combining with this a tolerably good shading quality,
and being in addition capable of easy reproduction, it is of highest
"forest value."</p>

<p>Hence, as the object of forestry is to make money from continued
wood crops, use value and forest value must both be considered in The
selection of materials for forest planting.</p>

<p><i>Mutual relationship of different species</i>, with reference especially to
their relative height growth and their relative light requirements, must
be considered in starting a mixed plantation.</p>

<p>Mixed forest plantations (made of several kinds) have so many advantages
over pure plantations (made of one kind) that they should be
preferred, except for very particular reasons. Mixed plantations are
capable of producing larger quantities of better and more varied
material, preserve soil conditions hotter, are less liable to damage from
winds, fires, and insects, and can be more readily reproduced.</p>

<p>The following general rules should guide in making up the composition
of a mixed plantation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> Shade-enduring kinds should form the bulk (five-eighths to seven-eighths) of
the plantation, except on specially favored soils where no deterioration is to be
feared from planting only light-needing kinds, and in which case those may even
be planted by themselves.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The light-needing trees should be surrounded by shade-enduring of slower
growth, so that the former may not be overtopped, but have the necessary light and
be forced by side shade to straight growth.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Shade-enduring species may be grown in admixture with each other when their
rate of height growth is about equal, or when the slower-growing kind can be protected
against the quicker-growing (for instance, by planting a larger proportion of
the former in groups or by cutting back the latter).</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The more valuable timber trees which are to form the main crop should be so
disposed individually, and planted in such numbers among the secondary crop or
nurse crop, that the latter can be thinned out first without disturbing the former.</p></div>

<p>Where a plantation of light-foliaged trees has been made (black
walnut, for instance), it can be greatly improved by "under-planting"
densely with a shade-enduring kind, which will choke out weed growth,
improve the soil, and thereby advance the growth of the plantation.</p>

<p>The selection and proper combination of species with reference to
this mutual relationship to each other and to the soil are the most important
elements of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>Availability</i> of the species also still needs consideration in this
country; for, although a species may be very well adapted to the purpose
in hand, it may be too difficult to obtain material for planting in
quantity or at reasonable prices. While the beech is one of the best
species for shade endurance, and hence for soil cover, seedlings can not
be had as yet in quantity. Western conifers, although promising good
material for forest planting, are at present too high priced for general
use. Some eastern trees can be secured readily&mdash;either their seed or
seedlings&mdash;from the native woods; others must be grown in nurseries
before they can be placed in the field.</p>

<p><i>Whether to procure seeds or plants</i>, and if the latter, what kind,
depends upon a number of considerations. The main crop, that which
is to furnish the better timber, had best be planted with nursery-grown
plants, if of slow-growing kinds, perhaps once transplanted, with well-developed
root systems, the plants in no case to be more than 2 to 3
years old. The secondary or nurse crop may then be sown or planted
with younger and less costly material taken from the woods or grown
in seed beds, or else cuttings may be used.</p>

<p>In some localities&mdash;for instance, the Western plains&mdash;the germinating
of seeds in the open field is so uncertain, and the life of the young
seedlings for the first year or two so precarious, that the use of seeds
in the field can not be recommended. In such locations careful selection
and treatment of the planting material according to the hardships
which it must encounter can alone insure success.</p>

<p>Seedlings from 6 to 12 inches high furnish the best material. The
planting of large-sized trees is not excluded, but is expensive and
hence often impracticable, besides being less sure of success, since
the larger-sized tree is apt to lose a greater proportion of its roots in
transplanting.</p>


<h3><a id="METHODS_OF_PLANTING"></a>METHODS OF PLANTING.</h3>

<p><i>Preparation of soil</i> is for the purpose of securing a favorable start for
the young crop; its effects are lost after the first few years. Most land
that is to be devoted to forest planting does not admit of as careful
preparation as for agricultural crops, nor is it necessary where the
climate is hot too severe and the soil not too compact to prevent the
young crop from establishing itself. Thousands of acres in Germany
are planted annually without any soil preparation, yearling pine seedlings
being set with a dibble in the unprepared ground. This absence
of preparation is even necessary in sandy soils, like that encountered
in the sand-hills of Nebraska, which may, if disturbed, be blown out and
shifted. In other cases a partial removal of a too rank undergrowth
or soil cover and a shallow scarifying or hoeing is resorted to, or else
furrows are thrown up and the trees set out in them.</p>

<p>In land that has been tilled, deep plowing (10 to 12 inches) and
thorough pulverizing give the best chances for the young crop to start.
For special conditions, very dry or very moist situations, special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
methods are required. The best methods for planting in the semiarid
regions of the far West have not yet been developed. Thorough cultivation,
as for agricultural crops, with subsequent culture, is successful,
but expensive. A plan which might be tried would consist in breaking
the raw prairie in June and turning over a shallow sod, sowing a crop
of oats or alfalfa, harvesting it with a high stubble, then opening furrows
for planting and leaving the ground between furrows undisturbed,
so as to secure the largest amount of drainage into the furrows and a
mulch between the rows.</p>

<p><i>The time for planting</i> depends on climatic and soil conditions and the
convenience of the planter. Spring planting is preferable except in
southern latitudes, especially in the West, where the winters are severe
and the fall apt to be dry, the soil therefore not in favorable condition
for planting.</p>

<p>The time for fall planting is after the leaves have fallen; for spring
planting, before or just when life begins anew. In order to be ready
in time for spring planting, it is a good practice to take up the plants in
the fall and "heel them in" over winter (covering them, closely packed,
in a dry trench of soil). Conifers can be planted later in spring and
earlier in fall than broad-leaved trees.</p>

<p><i>The density</i> of the trees is a matter in which most planters fail. The
advantages of close planting lie in the quicker shading of the soil, hence
the better preservation of its moisture and improved growth and form
development of the crop. These advantages must be balanced against
the increased cost of close planting. The closer the planting, the sooner
will the plantation be self-sustaining and the surer the success.</p>

<p>If planted in squares, or, better still, in quincunx order (the trees in
every other row alternating at equal distances), which is most desirable
on account of the more systematic work possible and the more complete
cover which it makes, the distance should not be more than 4 feet,
unless for special reasons and conditions, while 2 feet apart is not too
close, and still closer planting is done by nature with the best success.</p>

<p>The following numbers of trees per acre are required when planting
at distances as indicated:</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr>
  <td>1&frac12;</td>
  <td>by</td>
  <td>1&frac12; feet</td>
  <td class="tdr">19,360</td>
  <td class="bdl">2</td>
  <td>by</td>
  <td>4 feet</td>
  <td class="tdr">6,445</td>

<tr>
  <td>1&frac12;</td>
  <td>by</td>

  <td class="tdr">14,520</td>

  <td class="bdl">4</td>
  <td>by</td>
  <td>4 feet</td>
  <td class="tdr">2,722</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To decrease expense, the bulk of the plantation may be made of the
cheapest kinds of trees that may serve as soil cover and secondary or
nurse crop, the main crop of from 300 to 600 trees to consist of better
kinds, and with better planting material, mainly of light-needing species.
These should be evenly disposed through the plantation, each closely
surrounded by the nurse crop. It is, of course, understood that not all
trees grow up; a constant change in numbers by the death (or else
timely removal) of the overshaded takes place, so that the final crop
shows at 100 years a close cover, with hardly 300 trees to the acre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>After-culture</i> is not entirely avoidable, especially under unfavorable
climatic conditions, and if the planting was not close enough. Shallow
cultivation between the rows is needed to prevent weed growth and to
keep the soil open, until it is shaded by the young trees, which may take
a year with close planting and two or three years with rows 4 by 4 feet
apart, the time varying also with the species.</p>

<p>It is rare that a plantation succeeds in all its parts; gaps or fail
places occur, as a rule, and must be filled in by additional planting as
soon as possible, if of larger extent than can be closed up in a few
years by the neighboring growth.</p>

<p>When the soil is protected by a complete leaf canopy, the forest crop
may be considered as established, and the after-treatment will consist
of judicious thinning.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HOW_TO_TREAT_THE_WOOD_LOT" id="HOW_TO_TREAT_THE_WOOD_LOT">3. HOW TO TREAT THE WOOD LOT.</a></h2>


<p>In the northeastern States it is the custom to have connected with
the farm apiece of virgin woodland, commonly called the wood lot. Its
object primarily is to supply the farmer with the firewood, fence material,
and such dimension timbers as he may need from time to time for
repairs on buildings, wagons, etc.</p>

<p>As a rule, the wood lot occupies, as it ought to, the poorer part of the
farm, the rocky or stony, the dry or the wet portions, which are not well
fitted for agricultural crops. As a rule, it is treated as it ought not to
be, if the intention is to have it serve its purpose continuously; it is
cut and culled without regard to its reproduction.</p>

<p>As far as firewood supplies go, the careful farmer will first use the
dead and dying trees, broken limbs, and leavings, which is quite proper.
The careless man avoids the extra labor which such material requires,
and takes whatever splits best, no matter whether the material could
be used for better purposes or not.</p>

<p>When it comes to the cutting of other material, fence rails, posts, or
dimension timber, the general rule is to go into the lot and select the
best trees of the best kind for the purpose. This looks at first sight
like the natural, most practical way of doing. It is the method which
the lumberman pursues when he "culls" the forest, and is, from his point
of view perhaps, justifiable, for he only desires to secure at once what
is most profitable in the forest. But for the farmer, who proposes to use
his wood lot continuously for supplies of this kind, it is a method detrimental
to his object, and in time it leaves him with a lot of poor, useless
timber which encumbers the ground and prevents the growth of a
better crop.</p>

<p>Our woods are mostly composed of many species of trees; they are
mixed woods. Some of the species are valuable for some special purposes,
others are applicable to a variety of purposes, and again others
furnish but poor material for anything but firewood, and even for that
use they may not be of the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>

<p>Among the most valuable in the northeastern woods we should mention
the white pine&mdash;king of all&mdash;the white ash, white and chestnut oak,
hickories, tulip tree, black walnut, and black cherry, the last three being
now nearly exhausted; next, spruce and hemlock, red pine, sugar maple,
chestnut, various oaks of the black or red oak tribe, several species of
ash and birch, black locust; lastly, elms and soft maples, basswood,
poplars, and sycamore.</p>

<p>Now, by the common practice of culling the best it is evident that
gradually all the best trees of the best kinds are taken out, leaving only
inferior trees or inferior kinds&mdash;the weeds among trees, if one may call
them such&mdash;and thus the wood lot becomes well-nigh useless.</p>

<p>It does not supply that for which it was intended; the soil, which
was of little use for anything but a timber crop before, is still further
deteriorated under this treatment, and being compacted by the constant
running of cattle, the starting of a crop of seedlings is made
nearly impossible. It would not pay to turn it into tillage ground or
pasture; the farm has by so much lost in value. In other words, instead
of using the interest on his capital, interest and capital have been used
up together; the goose that laid the golden egg has been killed.</p>

<p>This is not necessary if only a little system is brought into the management
of the wood lot and the smallest care is taken to avoid deterioration
and secure reproduction.</p>


<h3><a id="IMPROVEMENT_CUTTINGS"></a>IMPROVEMENT CUTTINGS.</h3>

<p>The first care should be to improve the crop in its composition.
Instead of culling it of its best material, it should be culled of its
weeds, the poor kinds, which we do not care to reproduce, and which,
like all other weeds, propagate themselves only too readily. This weeding
must not, however, be done all sit once, as it could be in a field crop,
for in a full-grown piece of woodland each tree has a value, even the
weed trees, as soil cover.</p>

<p>The great secret of success in all crop production lies in the regulating
of water supplies; the manuring in part and the cultivating entirely,
as well as drainage and irrigation, are means to this end. In forestry
these means are usually not practicable, and hence other means are
resorted to. The principal of these is to keep the soil as much as possible
under cover, either by the shade which the foliage of the tall trees
furnishes, or by that from the underbrush, or by the litter which accumulates
and in decaying forms a humus cover, a most excellent mulch.</p>

<p>A combination of these three conditions, viz, a dense crown cover,
woody underbrush where the crown cover is interrupted, and a heavy
layer of well-decomposed humus, gives the best result. Under such
conditions, first of all, the rain, being intercepted by the foliage and
litter, reaches the ground only gradually, and therefore does not compact
the soil as it does in the open field, but leaves it granular and
open, so that the water can readily penetrate and move in the soil.
Secondly, the surface evaporation is considerably reduced by the shade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
and lack of air circulation in the dense woods, be that more moisture
remains for the use of the trees. When the shade of the crowns overhead
(the so-called "crown cover," or "canopy,") is perfect, but little
undergrowth will be seen; but where the crown cover is interrupted or
imperfect, an undergrowth will appear. If this is composed of young
trees, or even shrubs, it is an advantage, but if of weeds, and especially
grass, it is a misfortune, because these transpire a great deal more water
than the woody plants and allow the soil to deteriorate in structure and
therefore in water capacity.</p>

<p>Some weeds and grasses, to be sure, are capable of existing where
but little light reaches the soil. When they appear it is a sign to the
forester that he must be careful not to thin out the crown cover any
more. When the more light-needing weeds and grasses appear it is a
sign that too much light reaches the ground, and that the soil is already
deteriorated. If this state continues, the heavy drain which the transpiration
of these weeds makes upon the soil moisture, without any
appreciable conservative action by their shade, will injure the soil still
further.</p>

<p>The overhead shade or crown cover may be imperfect because there
are not enough trees on the ground to close up the interspaces with
their crowns, or else because the kinds of trees which make up the
forest do not yield much shade; thus it can easily be observed that a
beech, a sugar maple, a hemlock, is so densely foliaged that but little
light reaches the soil through its crown canopy, while an ash, an oak,
a larch, when full grown, in the forest, allows a good deal of light to
penetrate.</p>

<p>Hence, in our weeding process for the improvement of the wood crop,
we must be careful not to interrupt the crown cover too much, and
thereby deteriorate the soil conditions. And for the same reason, in
the selection of the kinds that are to be left or to be taken out, we
shall not only consider their use value but also their shading value,
trying to bring about such a mixture of shady and less shady kinds as
will insure a continuously satisfactory crown cover, the shade-enduring
kinds to occupy the lower stratum in the crown canopy, and to be more
numerous than the light-needing.</p>

<p>The forester, therefore, watches first the conditions of his soil cover,
and his next care is for the condition of the overhead shade, the "crown
cover;" for a change in the condition of the latter brings change into
his soil conditions, and, inversely, from the changes in the plant cover of
the soil he judges whether he may or may not change the light conditions.
The changes of the soil cover teach him more often when "to let
alone" than when to go on with his operations of thinning out; that
is to say, he can rarely stop short of that condition which is most favorable.
Hence the improvement cuttings must be made with caution
and only very gradually, so that no deterioration of the soil conditions
be invited. We have repeated this injunction again and again, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
all success in the management of future wood crops depends upon the
care bestowed upon the maintenance of favorable soil conditions.</p>

<p>As the object of this weeding is not only to remove the undesirable
kinds from the present crop, but to prevent as much as possible their
reappearance in subsequent crops, it maybe advisable to cut such kinds
as sprout readily from the stump in summer time&mdash;June or July&mdash;when
the stumps are, likely to die without sprouting.</p>

<p>It may take several years' cutting to bring the composition of the
main crop into such a condition as to satisfy us.</p>


<h3><a id="METHODS_OF_REPRODUCING"></a>METHODS OF REPRODUCING THE WOOD CROP.</h3>

<p>Then comes the period of utilizing the main crop. As we propose to
keep the wood lot as such, and desire to reproduce a satisfactory wood
crop in place of the old one, this latter must be cut always with a view
to that reproduction. There are various methods pursued for this purpose
in large forestry operations which are not practicable on small
areas, especially when these are expected to yield only small amounts
of timber, and these little by little as required. It is possible, to be
sure, to cut the entire crop and replant a new one, or else to use the ax
skillfully and bring about a natural reproduction in a few years; but
we want in the present case to lengthen out the period during which
the old crop is cut, and hence must resort to other methods. There are
three methods practicable.</p>

<p>We may clear narrow strips or bands entirely, expecting the neighboring
growth to furnish the seed for covering the strip with a new crop&mdash;"the
strip method;" or we can take out single trees here and there,
relying again on an after growth from seed shed by the surrounding
trees&mdash;the "selection method;" or, finally, instead of single trees, we
may cut entire groups of trees hero and there in the same manner, the
gaps to be filled, as in the other cases, with a young crop from the seed
of the surrounding trees, and this we may call the "group method."</p>

<p>In <i>the strip method</i>, in order to secure sufficient seeding of the cleared
strip, the latter must not be so broad that the seed from the neighboring
growth can not be carried over it by the wind. In order to get the
best results from the carrying power of the wind (as well as to avoid
windfalls when the old growth is suddenly opened on the windward side)
the strips should be located on the side opposite the prevailing winds.
Oaks, beech, hickory, and nut trees in general with heavy seeds will not
seed over any considerable breadth of strip, while with maple and ash
the breadth may be made twice as great as the height of the timber, and
the mother trees with lighter seeds, like spruce and pine, or birch and
elm, maybe able to cover strips of a breadth of 3 or 4 and even 8 times
their height. But such broad strips are hazardous, since with insufficient
seed fall, or fail years in the seed, the strip may remain exposed
to sun and wind for several years without a good cover and deteriorate.
It is safer, therefore, to make the strips no broader than just the height
of the neighboring timber, in which case not only has the seed better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
chance of covering the ground, but the soil and seedlings have more
protection from the mother crop. In hilly country the strips must not
be made in the direction of the slope, for the water would wash out soil
and seed.</p>

<p>Every year, then, or from time to time, a new strip is to be cleared and
"regenerated." But if the first strip failed to cover itself satisfactorily,
the operation is stopped, for it would be unwise to remove the seed trees
further by an additional clearing. Accordingly, this method should be
used only where the kinds composing the mother crop are frequent and
abundant seeders and give assurance of reseeding the strips quickly
and successfully.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 522px;">
<a name="fig_13"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Showing plan of group system in regenerating a forest crop. 1, 2, 3, 4, successive
groups of young timber, 1 being the oldest, 4 the youngest, 5 old timber; <i>a</i>, wind
mantle, specially managed to secure protection.</div>
</div>

<p>The other two methods have greater chances of success in that they
preserve the soil conditions more surely, and there is more assurance of
seeding from the neighboring trees on all sides.</p>

<p><i>The selection method</i>, by which single trees are taken out all over the
forest, is the same as has been practiced by the farmer and lumberman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
hitherto, only they have forgotten to look after the young crop. Millions
of seed may fall to the ground and germinate, but perish from the excessive
shade of the mother trees. If we wish to be successful in establishing
a new crop, it will be necessary to be ready with the ax all the
time and give light as needed by the young crop. The openings made
by taking out single trees are so small that there is great danger of the
young crop being lost, or at least impeded in its development, because
it is impracticable to come in time to its relief with the ax.</p>

<p>The best method, therefore, in all respects, is the "<i>group method</i>"
which not only secures continuous soil cover, chances for full seeding,
and more satisfactory light conditions, but requires loss careful attention,
or at least permits more freedom of movement and adaptation to
local conditions (<a href="#fig_13">fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>It is especially adapted to mixed woods, as it permits securing for each
species the most desirable light conditions by making the openings larger
or smaller, according as the species we wish to favor in a particular group
demand more or less shade. Further, when different species are ripe
for regeneration at different times, this plan makes it possible to take
them in hand as needed. Again, we can begin with one group or we can
take in hand several groups simultaneously, as may be desirable and
practicable.</p>

<p>We start our groups of new crop either where a young growth is
already on the ground, enlarging around it, or where old timber has
reached its highest usefulness and should be cut in order that we may
not lose the larger growth which young trees would make; or else we
choose a place which is but poorly stocked, where, if it is not regenerated,
the soil is likely to deteriorate further. The choice is affected
further by the consideration that dry situations should be taken in hand
earlier than those in which the soil and site are more favorable, and
that some species reach maturity and highest use value earlier than
others and should therefore be reproduced earlier. In short, we begin
the regeneration when and where the necessity for it exists, or where
the young crop has the best chance to start most satisfactorily with the
least artificial aid. Of course, advantage should betaken of the occurrence
of seed years, which come at different intervals with different
species.</p>

<p>If we begin with a group of young growth already on the ground,
our plan is to remove gradually the old trees standing over them when
no longer required for shade, and then to cut away the adjoining old
growth and enlarge the opening in successive narrow bands around
the young growth. When the first band has seeded itself satisfactorily,
and the young growth has come to require more light (which
may take several years), we remove another band around it, and thus
the regeneration progresses. Where no young growth already exists,
of course the first opening is made to afford a start, and afterwards the
enlargement follows as occasion requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="SIZE_OF_OPENINGS"></a>SIZE OF OPENINGS.</h3>

<p>The size of the openings and the rapidity with which they should be
enlarged vary, of course, with local conditions and the species which is
to 'be favored, the light-needing species requiring larger openings and
quicker light additions than the shade-enduring. It is difficult to give
any rules, since the modifications due to local conditions are so manifold,
requiring observation and judgment. Caution in not opening too
much at a time and too quickly may avoid failure in securing good stands.</p>

<p>In general, the first openings may contain from one-fourth to one-half
an acre or more, and the gradual enlarging may progress by clearing
bands of a breadth not to exceed the height of the surrounding timber.</p>

<p>The time of the year when the cutting is to be done is naturally in
winter, when the farmer has the most leisure, and when the wood seasons
best after felling and is also most readily moved. Since it is
expected that the seed fallen in the autumn will sprout in the spring,
all wood should, of course, be removed from the seed ground.</p>

<p>The first opening, as well as the enlargement of the groups, should
not be made at once, but by gradual thinning out, if the soil is not in
good condition to receive and germinate the seed and it is impracticable
to put it in such condition by artificial means&mdash;hoeing or plowing.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite practicable&mdash;nay, sometimes very desirable&mdash;to
prepare the soil for the reception and germination of the seed. Where
undesirable undergrowth has started, it should be cut out, and where
the soil is deteriorated with weed growth or compacted by the tramping
of cattle, it should be hoed or otherwise scarified, so that the seed may
find favorable conditions. To let pigs do the plowing and the covering
of acorns is not an uncommon practice abroad.</p>

<p>It is also quite proper, if the reproduction from the seed of the surrounding
mother trees does not progress satisfactorily, to assist, when
an opportunity is afforded, by planting such desirable species as were
or were not in the composition of the original crop.</p>

<p>It may require ten, twenty, or forty years or more to secure the reproduction
of a wood lot in this way. A new growth, denser and better
than the old, with timber of varying age, will be the result. The progress
of the regeneration in groups is shown on the accompanying plan,
the different shadings showing the successive additions of young crop,
the darkest denoting the oldest parts, first regenerated. If we should
make a section through any one of the groups, this, ideally represented,
would be like <a href="#fig_14">figure 14</a>, the old growth on the outside, the youngest
new crop adjoining it, and tiers of older growths of varying height
toward the center of the group.</p>


<h3><a id="WIND_MANTLE"></a>WIND MANTLE.</h3>

<p>On the plan there will be noted a strip specially shaded, surrounding
the entire plat (<a href="#fig_13">fig. 13, <i>a</i></a>), representing a strip of timber which should
surround the farmer's wood lot, and which he should keep as dense as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
possible, especially favoring undergrowth. This part, if practicable,
should be kept reproduced as coppice or by the method of selection,
i. e., by taking out trees hero and there. When gaps are made, they
should be filled, if possible, by introducing shade-enduring kinds, which,
like the spruces and firs and beech, retain their branches down to the
foot for a long time. This mantle is intended to protect the interior
against the drying influence of winds, which are bound to enter the
small wood lot and deteriorate the soil. The smaller the lot, the more
necessary and desirable it is to maintain such a protective cover or
wind-break.</p>

</div>


<h3><a id="COPPICE"></a>COPPICE.</h3>

<p>Besides reproducing a wood crop from the seed of mother trees or by
planting, there is another reproduction possible by sprouts from the
stump. This, to be sure, can be done only with broad-leaved species,
since conifers, with but few exceptions, do not sprout from the stump.
When a wood lot is cut over and over again, the reproduction taking
place by such sprouts we call coppice.</p>

<p>Most wooded areas in the Eastern States have been so cut that reproduction
from seed could not take place, and hence we have large areas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
of coppice, with very few seedling trees interspersed. As we have seen
in the chapter on "How trees grow," the sprouts do not develop into
as good trees as the seedlings. They grow faster, to be sure, in the
beginning, but do not grow as tall and are apt to be shorter lived.</p>

<p>For the production of firewood, fence, and post material, coppice management
may suffice, but not for dimension timber. And even to keep
the coppice in good reproductive condition, care should be taken to
secure a certain proportion of seedling trees, since the old stumps, after
repeated cutting, tail to sprout and die out.</p>

<p>Soil and climate influence the success of the coppice; shallow soils
produce weaker but more numerous sprouts and are more readily deteriorated
by the repeated laying bare of the soil; a mild climate is most
favorable to a continuance of the reproductive power of the stump.</p>

<p>Some species sprout more readily than others; hence the composition
of the crop will change, unless attention is paid to it. In the coppice,
as in any other management of a natural wood crop, a desirable composition
must first be secured, which is done by timely improvement
cuttings, as described in a previous section.</p>

<p>The best trees for coppice in the northeastern States are the chestnut,
various oaks, hickory, ash, elm, maples, basswood, and black locust,
which are all good sprouters.</p>

<p>When cutting is done for reproduction, the time and manner are the
main care. The best results are probably obtained, both financially
and with regard to satisfactory reproduction, when the coppice is cut
between the twentieth and thirtieth years. All cutting must be done
in early spring or in winter, avoiding, however, days of severe frost,
which is apt to sever the bark from the trunk and to kill the cambium.
Cutting in summer kills the stump, as a rule. The cut should be made
slanting downward, and as smooth as possible, to prevent collection of
moisture on the stump and the resulting decay, and as close as possible
to the ground, where the stump is less exposed to injuries, and the new
sprouts, starting close to the ground, may strike independent roots.</p>

<p>Fail places or gaps should be filled by planting. This can be readily
done by bending to the ground some of the neighboring sprouts, when 2
to 3 years old, notching, fastening them down with a wooden hook or
a stone, and covering them with soil a short distance (4 to 6 inches)
from the end. The sprout will then strike root, and after a year or so
may be severed from the mother stock by a sharp cut (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p>For the recuperation of the crop, it is desirable to maintain a supply
of seedling trees, which may be secured either by the natural seeding of
a few mother trees of the old crop which are left, or by planting. This
kind of management, coppice with seedling or standard trees intermixed,
if the latter are left regularly and well distributed over the
wood lot, leads to a management called "standard coppice." In this
it is attempted to avoid the drawbacks of the coppice, viz, failure to
produce dimension material and running out of the stocks. The former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
object is, however, only partially accomplished, as the trees grown without
sufficient side shading are apt to produce branchy boles and hence
knotty timber, besides injuring the coppice by their shade.</p>


<h3><a id="PLAN_OF_MANAGEMENT"></a>PLAN OF MANAGEMENT.</h3>

<p>In order to harmonize the requirements of the wood lot from a sylvicultural
point of view, and the needs of the farmer for wood supplies,
the cutting must follow some systematic plan.</p>

<p>The improvement cuttings need not, in point of time, have been made
all over the lot before beginning the cuttings for regeneration, provided
they have been made in those parts which are to be regenerated. Both
the cuttings may go on simultaneously, and this enables the farmer to
gauge the amount of cutting to his consumption. According to the
amount of wood needed, one or more groups may be started at the same
time. It is, however, desirable, for the sake of renewing the crop
systematically, to arrange the groups in a regular order over the lot.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_CULTIVATE_THE_WOOD_CROP" id="HOW_TO_CULTIVATE_THE_WOOD_CROP">4. HOW TO CULTIVATE THE WOOD CROP.</a></h2>


<p>Where only firewood is desired, i. e., wood without special form, size,
or quality, no attention to the crop is necessary, except to insure that
it covers the ground completely. Nevertheless, even in such a crop,
which is usually managed as coppice,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> some of the operations described
in this chapter may prove advantageous. Where, however, not only
quantity but useful quality of the crop is also to be secured, the development
of the wood crop may be advantageously influenced by controlling
the supply of light available to the individual trees.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> See <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a> for description of coppice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>It may be proper to repeat here briefly what has been explained in
previous pages regarding the influence of light on tree development.</p>


<h3><a id="EFFECT_OF_LIGHT"></a>EFFECT OF LIGHT ON WOOD PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Dense shade preserves soil moisture, the most essential element for
wood production; a close stand of suitable kinds of trees secures this
shading and prevents the surface evaporation of soil moisture, making
it available for wood production. But a close stand also cuts off side
light and confines the lateral growing space, and hence prevents the
development of side branches and forces the growth energy of the soil
to expend itself in height growth; the crown is carried up, and long,
cylindrical shafts, clear of branches, are developed; a close stand thus
secures desirable form and quality. Yet, since the quality of wood production
or accretion (other things being equal) is in direct proportion
to the amount of foliage and the available light, and since an open
position promotes the development of a larger crown and of more foliage,
an open stand tends to secure a larger amount of wood accretion
on each tree. On the other hand, a tree grown in the open, besides
producing more branches, deposits a larger proportion of wood at The
base, so that the shape of the bole becomes more conical, a form which
in sawing proves unprofitable; whereas a tree grown in the dense forest
both lengthens its shaft at the expense of branch growth and makes
a more even deposit of wood over the whole trunk, thus attaining a more
cylindrical form. While, then, the total amount of wood production per
acre may be as large in a close stand of trees as in an open one (within
limits), the distribution of this amount among a larger or smaller number
of individual trees produces different results in the quality of the
crop. And since the size of a tree or log is important in determining
its usefulness and value, the sooner the individual trees reach useful
size, without suffering in other points of quality, the more profitable the
whole crop.</p>


<h3><a id="NUMBER_OF_TREES"></a>NUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE.</h3>

<p>The care of the forester, then, should be to maintain the smallest
number of individuals on the ground which will secure the greatest
amount of wood growth in the most desirable form of which the soil
and climate are capable, without deteriorating the soil conditions. He
tries to secure the most advantageous individual development of single
trees without suffering the disadvantages resulting from too open
stand. The solution of this problem requires the greatest skill and
judgment, and rules can hardly be formulated with precision, since for
every species or combination of species and conditions these rules
must be modified.</p>

<p>In a well-established young crop the number of seedlings per acre
varies greatly, from 3,000 to 100,000, according to soil, species, and
the manner in which it originated, whether planted, sown, or seeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
naturally.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Left to themselves, the seedlings, as they develop, begin to
crowd each other. At first this crowding results only in increasing
the height growth and in preventing the spread and full development
of side branches; by and by the lower branches failing to receive sufficient
light finally die and break off&mdash;the shaft "clears itself." Then a
distinct development of definite crowns takes place, and after some
years a difference of height growth in different individuals becomes
marked. Not a few trees fail to reach the general upper crown surface,
and, being more or less overtopped, we can readily classify them according
to height and development of crown, the superior or "dominating"
ones growing more and more vigorously, the inferior or "dominated"
trees falling more and more behind, and finally dying for lack of light,
and thus a natural reduction in numbers, or thinning, takes place. This
natural thinning goes on with varying rates at different ages continuing
through the entire life of the crop, so that, while only 4,000 trees
per acre may be required in the tenth year to make a dense crown cover
or normally close stand, untouched by man, in the fortieth year 1,200
would suffice to make the same dense cover, in the eightieth year 350
would be a full stand, and in the one hundredth not more than 250,
according to soil and species, more or less. As we can discern three
stages in the development of a single tree&mdash;the juvenile, adolescent,
and mature&mdash;so, in the development of a forest growth, we may distinguish
three corresponding stages, namely, the "thicket" or brushwood,
the "pole-wood" or sapling, and the "timber" stage. During The
thicket stage, in which the trees have a bushy appearance, allowing
hardly any distinction of stem and crown, the height growth is most
rapid. This period may last, according to conditions and species, from
5 or 10 to 30 and even 40 years&mdash;longer on poor soils and with shade-enduring
species, shorter with light-needing species on good soils&mdash;and,
while it lasts, it is in the interest of the wood grower to maintain the
close stand, which produces the long shaft, clear of branches, on which
at a later period the wood that makes valuable, clear timber, may
accumulate. Form development is now most important. The lower
branches are to die and break off before they become too large. (See
illustrations of the progress of "clearing," on pp. <a href="#Page_15">15</a> and <a href="#Page_16">16</a>.) With
light-needing species and with deciduous trees generally this dying off
is accomplished more easily than with conifers. The spruces and even
the white pine require very dense shading to "clear" the shaft. During
this period it is only necessary to weed out the undesirable kinds,
such as trees infested by insect and fungus, shrubs, sickly, stunted, or
bushy trees which are apt to overtop and prevent the development of
their better neighbors. In short, our attention is now devoted mainly
to improving the composition of the crop.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> If the crop does not, at 3 to 5 years of age, shade the ground well, with a complete
crown cover, or canopy, it can not be said to be well established and should be filled
out by planting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span></p></div>


<h3><a id="WEEDING_AND_CLEANING"></a>WEEDING AND CLEANING THE CROP.</h3>

<p>This weeding or cleaning is easily done with shears when the crop is
from 3 to 5 years old. Later, mere cutting back of the undesirable trees
with a knife or hatchet maybe practiced. In well-made artificial plantations
this weeding is rarely needed until about the eighth or tenth
year. But in natural growths the young crop is sometimes so dense
as to inordinately interfere with the development of the individual
trees. The stems then remain so slender that there is danger of their
being bent or broken by storm or snow when the growth is thinned out
later. In such cases timely thinning is indicated to stimulate more
rapid development of the rest of the crop. This can be done most
cheaply by cutting swaths or lanes one yard wide and us far apart
through the crop, leaving strips standing. The outer trees of the strip,
at least, will then shoot ahead and become the main crop. These weeding
or improvement cuttings, which must be made gradually and be
repeated every two or three years, are best performed during the summer
months, or in August and September, when it is easy to judge what
should be taken out.</p>


<h3><a id="METHODS_OF_THINNING"></a>METHODS OF THINNING.</h3>

<p>During the "thicket" stage, then, which may last from 10 to 25 and
more years, the crop is gradually brought into proper composition and
condition. When the "pole-wood" stage is reached, most of the saplings
being now from 3 to 6 inches in diameter and from 15 to 25 feet
in height, the variation in sizes and in appearance becomes more and
more marked. Some of the taller trees begin to show a long, clear
shaft and a definite crown. The trees can be more or less readily
classified into height and size classes. The rate at which the height
growth has progressed begins to fall off and diameter growth increases.
Now comes the time when attention must be given to increasing this
diameter growth by reducing the number of individuals and thus having
all the wood which the soil can produce deposited on fewer individuals.
This is done by judicious and often repeated thinning, taking out some
of the trees and thereby giving more light and increasing the foliage of
those remaining; and as the crowns expand, so do the trunks increase
their diameter in direct proportion. These thinnings must, however,
be made cautiously lest at the same time the soil is exposed too much,
or the branch growth of those trees which are to become timber wood
is too much stimulated. So varying are the conditions to be considered,
according to soil, site, species, and development of the crop, that it is
well-nigh impossible, without a long and detailed discussion, to lay
down rules for the proper procedure. In addition the opinions of authorities
differ largely both as to manner and degree of thinning, the old
school advising moderate, and the new school severer thinnings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span></p>

<p>For the farmer, who can give personal attention to detail and whose
object is to grow a variety of sizes and kinds of wood, the following
general method may perhaps be most useful:</p>

<p>First determine which trees are to be treated as the main crop or
"final harvest" crop. For this 300 to 500 trees per acre of the best
grown and most useful kinds may be selected, which should be distributed
as uniformly as possible over the acre. These, then&mdash;or as
many as may live till the final harvest&mdash;are destined to grow into
timber and are to form the special favorites as much as possible. They
may at first be marked to insure recognition; later on they will be
readily distinguished by their superior development The rest, which
we will call the "subordinate" crop, is then to serve merely as filler,
nurse, and soil cover.</p>


<h3><a id="WHAT_TREES_TO_REMOVE"></a>WHAT TREES TO REMOVE.</h3>

<p>It is now necessary, by careful observation of the surroundings of
each of the "final harvest" crop trees, or "superiors," as we may call
them, to determine what trees of the "subordinate" crop trees, or
"inferiors," must be removed. All nurse trees that threaten to overtop
the superiors must either be cut out or cut back and topped, if that is
practicable, so that the crown of the superiors can develop freely.
Those that are only narrowing in the superiors from the side, without
preventing their free top development, need not be interfered with,
especially while they are still useful in preventing the formation and
spreading of side branches on the superiors. As soon as the latter
have fully cleared their shafts, these crowding inferiors must be removed.
Care must be taken, however, not to remove too many at a time, thus
opening the crown cover too severely and thereby exposing the soil to
the drying influence of the sun. Gradually, as the crowns of inferiors
standing farther away begin to interfere with those of the superiors,
the inferiors are removed, and thus the full effect of the light is secured
in the accretion of the main harvest crop; at the same time the branch
growth has been prevented and the soil has been kept shaded. Meanwhile
thinnings may also be made in the subordinate crop, in order to
secure also the most material from this part of the crop. This is done
by cutting out all trees that threaten to be killed by their neighbors.
In this way many a useful stick is saved and the dead material, only
good for firewood, lessened. It is evident that trees which in the struggle
for existence have fallen behind, so as to be overtopped by their
neighbors, can not, either by their presence or by their removal, influence
the remaining growth. They are removed only in order to utilize
their wood before it decays.</p>

<p>It may be well to remark again that an undergrowth of woody plants
interferes in no way with the development of the main crop, but, on the
contrary, aids by its shade in preserving favorable moisture conditions.
Its existence, however, shows in most cases that the crown cover is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
as dense as it should be, and hence that thinning is not required.
Grass and weed growth, on the other hand, is emphatically disadvantageous
and shows that the crown cover is dangerously open.</p>

<p>The answer to the three questions, When to begin the thinnings,
How severely to thin, and How often to repeat the operation, must
always depend upon the varying appearance of the growth and the
necessities in each case. The first necessity for interference may arise
with light-needing species as early as the twelfth or fifteenth year; with
shade-enduring, not before the twentieth or twenty-fifth year. The
necessary severity of the thinning and the repetition are somewhat
interdependent. It is better to thin carefully and repeat the operation
oftener than to open up so severely at once as to jeopardize the soil
conditions. Especially in younger growths and on poorer soil, it is
best never to open a continuous crown cover so that it could not close
up again within 3 to 5 years; rather repeat the operation oftener.
Later, when the trees have attained heights of 50 to 60 feet and clear
boles (which may be in 40 to 50 years, according to soil and kind) the
thinning may be more severe, so as to require repetition only every
6 to 10 years.</p>

<p>The condition of the crown cover, then, is the criterion which directs
the ax. As soon as the crowns again touch or interlace, the time has
arrived to thin again. In mixed growths it must not be overlooked
that light-needing species must be specially protected against shadier
neighbors. Shade-enduring trees, such as the spruces, beech, sugar
maple, and hickories, bear overtopping for a time and will then grow vigorously
when more light is given, while light-needing species, like the
pines, larch, oaks, and ash, when once suppressed, may never be able to
recover.</p>

<p>Particular attention is called to the necessity of leaving a rather
denser "wind mantle" all around small groves. In this part of the
grove the thinning must be less severe, unless coniferous trees on the
outside can be encouraged by severe thinning to hold their branches
low down, thus increasing their value as wind-breaks.</p>

<p>The thinnings, then, while giving to the "final harvest" crop all the
advantage of light for promoting its rapid development into serviceable
timber size, furnish also better material from the subordinate crop.
At 60 to 70 years of age the latter may have been entirely removed and
only the originally selected "superiors" remain on the ground, or as
many of them as have not died and been removed; 250 to 400 of these
per acre will make a perfect stand of most valuable form and size, ready
for the final harvest, which should be made as indicated in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RELATION_OF_FORESTS_TO_FARMS" id="THE_RELATION_OF_FORESTS_TO_FARMS">5.&mdash;THE RELATION OF FORESTS TO FARMS.</a></h2>


<p>That all things in nature are related to each other and interdependent
is a common saying, a fact doubted by nobody, yet often
forgotten or neglected in practical life. The reason is partly indifference
and partly ignorance as to the actual nature of the relationship;
hence we suffer, deservedly or not.</p>

<p>The farmer's business, more than any other, perhaps, depends for
its success upon a true estimate of and careful regard for this inter-relation,
he adapts his crop to the nature of the soil, the manner
of its cultivation to the changes of the seasons, and altogether he
shapes conditions and places them in their proper relations to each
other and adapts himself to them.</p>

<p>Soil, moisture, and heat are the three factors which, if properly
related and utilized, combine to produce his crops. In some directions
he can control these factors more or less readily; in others they
are withdrawn from his immediate influence, and he is seemingly
helpless. He can maintain the fertility of the soil by manuring, by
proper rotation of crops, and by deep culture; he can remove surplus
moisture by ditching and draining; he can, by irrigation systems,
bring water to his crops, and by timely cultivation prevent excessive
evaporation, thereby rendering more water available to the crop;
but he can not control the rainfall nor the temperature changes of
the seasons. Recent attempts to control the rainfall by direct means
exhibit one of the greatest follies and misconceptions of natural
forces we have witnessed during this age. Nevertheless, by indirect
means the farmer has it in his power to exercise much greater control
over these forces than he has attempted hitherto. He can prevent or
reduce the unfavorable effects of temperature changes; he can increase
the available water supplies, and prevent the evil effects of excessive
rainfall; he can so manage the waters which fall as to get the most
benefit from them and avoid the harm which they are able to inflict.</p>

<p>Before attempting to control the rainfall itself by artifice, we should
study how to secure the best use of that which falls, as it comes within
reach of human agencies and becomes available by natural causes.</p>

<p>How poorly we understand the use of these water supplies is evidenced
yearly by destructive freshets and floods, with the accompanying
washing of soil, followed by droughts, low waters, and deterioration
of agricultural lands. It is claimed that annually in the United
States about 200 square miles of fertile soil are washed into brooks
and rivers, a loss of soil capital which can not be repaired for centuries.
At the same time millions of dollars are appropriated yearly in
the river and harbor bills to dig out the lost farms from the rivers, and
many thousands of dollars' worth of crops and other property are
destroyed by floods and overflows; not to count the large loss from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
droughts which this country suffers yearly in one part or the other,
and which, undoubtedly, could be largely avoided, if we knew how to
manage the available water supplies.</p>

<p>The regulation, proper distribution, and utilization of the rain
waters in humid as well as in arid regions&mdash;water management&mdash;is to
be the great problem of successful-agriculture in the future.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful means for such water management lies in
the proper distribution and maintenance of forest areas. Nay, we
can say that the most successful water management is not possible
without forest management.</p>


<h3><a id="FOREST_WATERS_FARM"></a>THE FOREST WATERS THE FARM.</h3>

<p>Whether forests increase the amount of precipitation within or near
their limits is still an open question, although there are indications
that under certain conditions large, dense forest areas may have such
an effect. At any rate, the water transpired by the foliage is certain,
in some degree, to increase the relative humidity near the forest, and
thereby increase directly or indirectly the water supplies in its neighborhood.
This much we can assert, also, that while extended plains
and fields, heated by the sun, and hence giving rise to warm currents
of air, have the tendency to prevent condensation of the passing
moisture-bearing currents, forest areas, with their cooler, moister air
strata, do not have such a tendency, and local showers may therefore
become more frequent in their neighborhood. But, though no increase
in the amount of rainfall may be secured by forest areas, the availability
of whatever falls is increased for the locality by a well-kept and
properly located forest growth. The foliage, twigs, and branches break
the fall of the raindrops, and so does the litter of the forest floor, hence
the soil under this cover is not compacted as in the open field, but
kept loose and granular, so that the water can readily penetrate and
percolate; the water thus reaches the ground more slowly, dripping
gradually from the leaves, branches, and trunks, and allowing more
time for it to sink into the soil. This percolation is also made easier
by the channels along the many roots. Similarly, on account of the
open structure of the soil and the slower melting of the snow under
a forest cover in spring, where it lies a fortnight to a month longer
than in exposed positions and melts with less waste from evaporation,
the snow waters more fully penetrate the ground. Again, more snow
is caught and preserved under the forest cover than on the wind-swept
fields and prairies.</p>

<p>All these conditions operate together, with the result that larger
amounts of the water sink into the forest soil and to greater depths
than in open fields. This moisture is conserved because of the reduced
evaporation in the cool and still forest air, being protected from the
two great moisture-dissipating agents, sun and wind. By these conditions
alone the water supplies available in the soil are increased from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
50 to 60 per cent over those available on the open field. Owing to
those two causes, then&mdash;increased percolation and decreased evaporation&mdash;larger
amounts of moisture become available to feed the springs
and subsoil waters, and these become finally available to the farm, if
the forest is located at a higher elevation than the field. The great
importance of the subsoil water especially and the influence of forest
areas upon it has so far received too little attention and appreciation.
It is the subsoil water that is capable of supplying the needed moisture
in times of drought.</p>


<h3><a id="FOREST_TEMPERS_FARM"></a>THE FOREST TEMPERS THE FARM.</h3>

<p>Another method by which a forest belt becomes a conservator of
moisture lies in its wind-breaking capacity, by which both velocity and
temperature of winds are modified and evaporation from the fields
to the leeward is reduced.</p>

<p>On the prairie, wind-swept every day and every hour, the farmer
has learned to plant a wind-break around his buildings and orchards,
often only a single-row of trees, and finds even that a desirable shelter,
tempering both the hot winds of summer and the cold blasts of winter.
The fields he usually leaves unprotected; yet a wind-break
around his crops to the windward would bring him increased yield,
and a timber belt would act still more effectively. Says a farmer
from Illinois:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My experience is that now in cold and stormy winters fields protected by timber
belts yield full crops, while fields not protected yield only one-third of a crop.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago we never had any wheat killed by winter frost,
and every year we had a full crop of peaches, which is now very rare. At that
time we had plenty of timber around our fields and orchards, now cleared away.</p></div>

<p>Not only is the temperature of the winds modified by passing over
and through the shaded and cooler spaces of protecting timber bolts
disposed toward the windward and alternating with the fields, but
their velocity is broken and moderated, and since with reduced
velocity the evaporative power of the winds is very greatly reduced,
so more water is left available for crops. Every foot in height of
a forest growth will protect 1 rod in distance, and several bolts in
succession would probably greatly increase the effective distance.
By preventing deep freezing of the soil the winter cold is not so
much prolonged, and the frequent fogs and mists that hover near
forest areas prevent many frosts. That stock will thrive better where
it can find protection from the cold blasts of winter and from the
heat of the sun in summer is a well-established fact.</p>


<h3><a id="FOREST_PROTECTS_FARM"></a>THE FOREST PROTECTS THE FARM.</h3>

<p>On the sandy plains, where the winds are apt to blow the sand,
shifting it hither and thither, a forest belt to the windward is the
only means to keep the farm protected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span></p>

<p>In the mountain and hill country the farms are apt to suffer from
heavy rains washing away the soil. Where the tops and slopes are
bared of their forest cover, the litter of the forest floor burnt up,
the soil trampled and compacted by cattle and by the patter of the
raindrops, the water can not penetrate the soil readily, but is earned
off superficially, especially when the soil is of, day and naturally
compact. As a result the waters, rushing over the surface down the
hill, run together in rivulets and streams and acquire such a force as
to be able to move loose particles and even stones; the ground becomes
furrowed with gullies and runs; the fertile soil is washed
away; the fields below are covered with silt; the roads are damaged;
the water courses tear their banks, and later run dry because the
waters that should feed them by subterranean channels have been
carried away in the flood.</p>

<p>The forest cover on the hilltops and steep hillsides which are not
fit for cultivation prevents this erosive action of the waters by the
same influence by which it increases available water supplies. The
important effects of a forest cover, then, are retention of larger quantities
of water and carrying them off under ground and giving them
up gradually, thus extending the time of their usefulness and preventing
their destructive action.</p>

<p>In order to be thoroughly effective, the forest growth must be dense,
and, especially, the forest floor must not be robbed of its accumulations
of foliage, surface mulch and litter, or its underbrush by fire,
nor must it be compacted by the trampling of cattle.</p>

<p>On the gentler slopes, which are devoted to cultivation, methods
of underdraining, such as horizontal ditches partly filled with stones
and covered with soil, terracing, and contour plowing, deep cultivation,
sodding, and proper rotation of crops, must be employed to prevent
damage from surface waters.</p>


<h3><a id="FOREST_SUPPLIES"></a>THE FOREST SUPPLIES THE FARM WITH USEFUL MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>All the benefits derived from the favorable influence of forest bolts
upon water conditions can be had without losing any of the useful
material that the forest produces. The forest grows to be cut and to
be utilized; it is a crop to be harvested. It is a crop which, if properly
managed, does not need to be replanted; it reproduces itself.</p>

<p>When once established, the ax, if properly guided by skillful hands,
is the only tool necessary to cultivate it and to reproduce it. There
is no necessity of planting unless the wood lot has been mismanaged.</p>

<p>The wood lot, then, if properly managed, is not only the guardian
of the farm, but it is the savings bank from which fair interest can
be annually drawn, utilizing for the purpose the poorest part of the
farm. Nor does the wood lot require much attention; it is to the farm
what the workbasket is to the good housewife&mdash;a means with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
improve the odds and ends of time, especially during the winter, when
other farm business is at a standstill.</p>

<p>It may be added that the material which the farmer can secure
from the wood lot, besides the other advantages recited above, is of
far greater importance and value than is generally admitted.</p>

<p>On a well-regulated farm of 160 acres, with its 4 miles and more of
fencing and with its wood fires in range and stove, at least 25 cords
of wood are required annually, besides material for repair of buildings,
or altogether the annual product of probably 40 to 50 acres of
well-stocked forest is needed. The product may represent, according
to location, an actual stumpage value of from $1 to $3 per acre, a sure
crop coming every year without regard to weather, without trouble
and work, and raised on the poorest part of the farm. It is questionable
whether such net results could be secured with the same steadiness
from any other crop. Nor must it be overlooked that the work
in harvesting this crop falls into a time when little else could be done.</p>

<p>Wire fences and coal fires are, no doubt, good substitutes, but they
require ready cash, and often the distance of haulage makes them
rather expensive. Presently, too, when the virgin woods have been
still further culled of their valuable stores, the farmer who has preserved
a sufficiently large and well-tended wood lot will be able to
derive a comfortable money revenue from it by supplying the market
with wood of various kinds and sizes. The German State forests, with
their complicated administrations, which eat up 4 per cent of the
gross income, yield, with prices of wood about the same as in our
country, an annual net revenue of from $1 to $4 and more per acre.
Why should not the farmer, who does not pay salaries to managers,
overseers, and forest guards, make at least as much money out of this
crop when he is within reach of a market?</p>

<p>With varying conditions the methods would of course vary. In
a general way, if he happens to have a virgin growth of mixed woods,
the first care would be to improve the composition of the wood lot by
cutting out the less desirable kinds, the weeds of tree growth, and the
poorly grown trees which impede the development of more deserving
neighbors.</p>

<p>The wood thus cut he will use as firewood or in any other way, and,
even if he could not use it at all, and had to burn it up, the operation
would pay indirectly by leaving him a better crop. Then he may use
the rest of the crop, gradually cutting the trees as needed, but he
must take care that the openings are not made too large, so that they
can readily fill out with young growth from the seed of the remaining
trees, and he must also pay attention to the young aftergrowth,
giving it light as needed. Thus without ever resorting to planting he
may harvest the old timber and have a now crop taking its place and
perpetuate the wood lot without in any way curtailing his use of
the same.</p>
